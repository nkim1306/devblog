## Useful Camera Angles and Shot Types

What sets Midjourney apart from actual photography is it's beginner friendly. Let's say you want to explore different camera angles and shot types yourself with traditional photography. You have to get appropriate gears, pick an appropriate time of the day, and go outside and take photos for yourself. Furthermore, you can only take so much photos per day. With Midjourney, you can explore a variety of camera angles and shot types right from the computer without much of a preparation.

This post is mainly focused on illustrating different examples of camera angles and shot types of Midjourney. Feel free to refer to this glossary of examples later in the future.

### **1. Eye-Level Shot:**

A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.

prompt:

```prompt
eye-level shot of a woman in NYC --style raw --750
```

![sample](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802033/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/1-eye-level_tymf6b.png)

### **2. Low-Angle Shot**

A camera angle that looks up at the subject from a lower position, often making the subject appear more dominant or powerful.

prompt:

```prompt
low-angle shot of a woman in NYC --style raw --s 750
```

![sample](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802033/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/2-low-angle_ng2wzn.png)

### **3. High-Angle Shot**

A camera angle that looks down at the subject from a higher position, often making the subject appear smaller or less significant.

prompt:

```prompt
high-angle shot of a woman in NYC --style raw
```

>NOTE:  deleted `stylize` tag: `--s 750` for `high-angle` shots

![sample](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802033/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/3-high-angle_vjv5pj.png)

### **4. Overhead Shot**

A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context. The camera is usually positioned at a relatively close distance to the subject, providing a clear view of the action or objects below.

prompt:

```prompt
overhead shot of a woman in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

>NOTE:  added `--ar 2:1`

![sample](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802031/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/4-overhead_lglrhs.webp)

### **5. Bird's Eye View**

This term generally implies a higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.

prompt:

```prompt
bird's-eye view of a woman in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![birdseye](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802031/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/4-overhead_lglrhs.webp)

> NOTE: While Overhead and Bird's-eye view are often used interchangeably, the main difference lies in the height or distance from which the shot is taken, with a bird's-eye view typically being higher or more distant than an overhead shot.

### TIP: **Optimization Strategy for Overhead and Bird's Eye shots**

You can see that for `overhead` shots, the person is closer to the ground level, whereas for `bird's-eye` shots, the person in on top of the building. This indeed signals that a `bird's-eye` shots are typically taken at a higher level than `overhead` shots. To maximize the effect we can add:

```prompt
on the road
```

or

```prompt
on the ground
```

to our prompt to maximize each effects.

### **Optimized Overhead Shot**

prompt:

```prompt
overhead shot of a woman on the road in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![sample](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802031/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/4-overhead-optimized_c6nzf3.webp)

### **Optimized Bird's-Eye View**

prompt:

```prompt
bird's-eye view of a woman on the road in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![birdseye-optimized](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802031/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/5-birdseye-optimized_kcxc5d.webp)

You can clearly see that the vantage point of `Bird's Eye View`

### **6. Drone Shot:**

An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.

prompt:

```prompt
drone shot of a woman on the road in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![drone](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802031/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/6-drone_k1q3nr.webp)

Doesn't make too much difference compared to `Bird's eye view` or `Overhead` shot. When I encounter an impasse like this, I assume there isn't much raw data for Midjourney to process a variety of shots regarding the provided prompt: `a woman on the road in NYC`. Let's just give it a more generic prompt and see.

more generic prompt:

```prompt
drone shot of a woman --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![drone-generic](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802032/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/6-drone-generic_cik4pp.webp)

>TIP: try using generic prompt if you are stuck with the same results between different angles

### **7. Worm's-eye view:**

A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.

prompt:

```prompt
Worm's-eye view shot of a woman --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![worms-eye](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802033/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/7-worms-eye-view_ocgbcr.png)

Looks scary isn't it? It's what we try to elicit using `Worm's Eye View`

### **8. Ground-level View:**

In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.

prompt:

```prompt
Ground-level view of a woman --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![ground-level](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802033/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/8-ground-level-shot_dxazqp.png)

### **9. Side View Shot:**

In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.

prompt:

```prompt
a side view shot of a woman in NYC --style raw --ar 2:1
```

![birdseye](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr7urwhzf/image/upload/v1690802034/nathan/1-camera-angles-shot-types/9-side-view-shot_rzrj6v.png)

### **10. Rule of Thirds Shot:**

The frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.

prompt:

```prompt
Rule of Thirds Shot of a woman in NYC --style raw
```

### More prompts for later

This list of different camera angles and shot types will continue to expand as I find more in the future. Once it's ready, I will combine all sources in a single PDF and release an e-book. Feel free to email me for those of you who are interested in an early bird access.
