## What is Midjourney

There are numerous sources out there illustrating what Midjourney is. Have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wePG8v5orjg), [this](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/design/midjourney-ai-art), and [this](https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/midjourney/) to get the whole picture.

Simply put, Midjourney is a software that creates images based on the descriptions you provide in plain, English sentences. It is powered by AI, meaning we don't fully understand the inner workings of its image creation process but it creates something fascinating in the end.

*giving an instruction to Midjourney is simple*

Using Midjourney is simple. It's like talking to your really artistically talented friend in a chat. You tell the friend what you want to see, this friend will quickly draw the image on the fly.

Our talented artistic friend Midjourney then comes up with some amazing images with different variations. I can pick the one I like by pressing selected `v1` or `v2` or `v3` or `v4`. The numbers are set on clockwise starting from the top left.

## Exploring different styles in Midjourney

You can be as adventurous as you'd like. But giving instructions to Midjourney isn't always that easy, and since it's still an open-beta version of the software as of 2023 July, Midjourney surely can't express every single detail that we provide to it.

After all, we have to know that Midjourney is an AI trained based off of real-life images available in the web. Meaning that it is confined to a certain styles that it has been trained on. Therefore, knowing distinct styles that Midjourney is good at portraying is very important to understanding what it can do for us. It's almost like reverse-engineering Midjourney to get the most juice out of it.

*midlibrary.io is a great place to start*

One of my favorite places to visit is [midlibrary](https://www.midlibrary.io/styles). You can see many different styles that Midjourney is capable of creating and also copy some of the `prompts` or `parameters` from the post.

Among the different types of images, I'm fascinated by Midjourney Photography. There are many aspects to play around such as lighting, angles, lens, and photographers in order to fully utilize Midjourney Photography capabilities. I will dedicate this entire `midjourney photography guide series`` exploring thes key parameters.
