## The Context

As explained in previous blog posts, our newest side hustle was to buy cheap clothes from TJMaxx and then export the clothes to buyers in South Korea for much cheaper than they could buy domestically. This would not only be a win-win for the consumer as it is cheap for them but it is easy profit for the seller as they can add a large premium service fee that still makes it cheaper than the stock prices in Korea. Now that the package has delivered, I got a lot of good feedback that I will share with you now.

## Main Feedback

Paraphrasing my friend, the package was a great success. Not only were all the clothes very satisfying and the exact quality he expected, it also shipped in a very reasonable time. He believes he saved a minimum of `$150`, even including the shipping and service fee I provided. While he did get a larger amount of clothes, this number is very valuable. This transaction proves that it is possible to earn a lot of money off of this side-hustle. If someone were able to continue this with many people, the possibilities for profit could be incredible.

The shipping took approximately one week from my house to all the way to Korea. KT Express did a fantastic job delivering the clothes at a very cheap price, even cheaper than the domestic shipping from my house to California. In addition, the clothes fit very will and the online communication we had while shopping was very helpful in choosing the right material, size, color, and overall opinion.

## What to Improve

Though the overall experience was great, some things could have been much better. Firstly, the shipping on my end was very expensive, making the shipping costs for the customer expensive as well. This must go down from `$80`to about `$30` to truly make the most out of the transaciton. Additionally, the sizing was a little difficult as sizes could be very different among companies as well as a difference from U.S. sizes and Korean sizes. This is a difficult issue that may cause issues, but overall in this case it worked out as sizes were good according to my friend.

In addition, the method we used to shop for the clothes was through google meet, which was not the most effiicent method but was good enough at the time. If we were to redo this process, it would be vital to find a new platform that can still sustain a good enough quality and have a good connection. The ideas we had included Facetime (but this excluded android users), Instagram Live, or Skype.
