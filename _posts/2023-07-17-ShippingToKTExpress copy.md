## Backflash

Now that I have the clothes from TJ Maxx and also declared what company I am going to export with, all that is left is to send it to the KT Valley Branch in Silicon Valley so they can ship the package to South Korea. This process is rather simple as all is needed is to ship the package to their branch in California, and they will do the rest internationally.

## How will the Clothes get to CA?

While there are many options available for shipping to the Silicon Valley Branch, the price is the biggest issue. Because the box for clothes is about the size of a large box(8” x 7” x 11”), I just need to find a company that can get our clothes to the shipping address quickly and cheaply.

This company was FedEx, being able to ship a large box (8-3/4” x 7-3/4” x 11-5/16”) in about 3 of 4 days for less than `$30`.

Other big name companies like UPS, USPS, DHL, and more were too expensive or annoying to use, but FedEx's process was rather simple. All that was needed was to create a shipping label by stating the box size, the location of delivery, and when to ship it.

## Step 1

To create the shipping label, the first step is to out in the location. Because KT Express already gave us the specific address of their Silicon Valley Branch, this process was pretty easy. The information was already easily accessible and took little time to find.

## Step 2

To create the shipping label, the second step is to select an option. Choosing the One Rate was signifigantly cheaper than the standard rates, almost a `$30` difference. I'm not too sure why the difference was so high as the package is only about 8 pounds as well, but either way the One Rate was always a better deal.

## Step 3

After choosing the box size and the shipping date, FedEx offers the estimated rate that will be required depending on the deliver services. While some choices are astronomically expensive such as the First Overnight, the Express Saver option at the latest is rather cheap. Thus, choosing the latest deliver made it just over `$25` with tax.

## What can we Take from this?

The issue coming into play with this shipping process is how will we ship our product to the conusmers quickly enough to where they will still want the product. Shipping takes quite some time if I go the cheaper route, but it could take too long for customers to find tolerable. On the contrary, going the faster route could be way to expensive, and the consumer could see the shipping cost too high. One loophole that is helping us exponentially is the sheer cheapness of KT Express. The entire process of getting out product from Silicon Valley, CA to South Korea was under `$50`. This is much better of an option than delivering internationally with FedEx or another company as this would increase to over `$200`. This advantage of cheaper delivery could be used to ship faster domestically and hopefully shrink the amount of time customer will wait.

Another issue could be seen in delivering the products for multiple customers. Shipping one or two orders at a time would be too inefficient and expensive, but doing too many in bulk may be difficult to sort out once the products arrive. This will be important to consider at the end of the day once we end our first trial of shipping the TJ Maxx Clothes.

## The First Invoice

After the delivery of the order was made, I created our final invoice including all the costs and processes of the TJMaxx side hustle. The costs included the 16 items, the shipping cost from my house to California, the shipping from California to South Korea, and the Service Fee. All of this came to `$403.06`, which is still substantially lower than what someone buying clothes domestically in Korea would pay.This number will also continue to decrease as I find a better solution for shipping the products in the U.S. for cheaper.

The Service fee was structure off the decreasing pertentage as this would hopefully encourage customers to buy in bulk, making the costs lower on both ends. Less shipping means cheaper service for us and the customer will have a lower service fee percentage, so win-win.

## Where's the Money?

To get the payment, the best option was to use Paypal as this wasn't restricted by Korean fiscal policies and was also an option available for my friend and I. One thing however we did not know was the transaction fee. PayPal has a set 3.49% processing fee in place as well as a `$0.49` per transaction on top. Though my friend offered to pay for this fee as well, we would have to figure out what to do about this number and whether to include it in the service fee charge or disergard it.

The big issue, however, with Paypal is that it doesn't allow users under 18 years old. This is a huge issues as many teens under 18 will make up a huge percentage of the demographics. As such, it could be most beneficial to use an online creditcard transaction page or perhaps find another transaction app like Paypal to get the payment.
