## The Beginning

Now that I have experimented five different side-hustle options with my own experience, it's time to start putting together the company that will hopefully spark into something huge. The name I chose was **QuickLyfe**, a name that has a nice ring and also represents how users can quickly transition towards a life that is money-stress free. The company will be similar to Gumroad or Udemy, course-based websites that sell information to users. However, I will have to make it free in the beginning just so I can attract as many people posible.

## Why QuickLyfe?

Like I described earlier, the company name stuck with me the moment I said it outloud, but the process behind the name was also very long. It took me about a month of just brainstorming names, checking the availabilty, and going back to the drawing board. The many ideas I produced were already taken, making it hard to keep starting fresh after coming up with one great idea.

After many tries, I finally decided to try to find some inspiration online. One such website was Namelix. This webstie was a gamechanger as all you do is type some keywords and a summary of the business, and the website creates AI Generated names and logos that are incredibly unique and appealing. This sped up my process instantly and after a couple days, I found **QuickLyfe**.
